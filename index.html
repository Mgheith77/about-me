    <p id="paragraph">Hello, my name is Mohammad but I prefer Mo. This page will give you a very general sense of who I am as a person.<br> I'm a first generation American Palestinian. I have an older brother(6 years) and an old sister (5 years + 1 day). <br> I've spent two years of my life in Palestine(2nd and 3rd grade) learning to read, write, and speak Arabic. I love cats, <br> I own one named Apollo. He's about a year and five months old. He's fat and energetic. I also love kids, just not the annoying ones.<br> I try to say I have a fashion sense but that's probably not true, I just love clothes,bags, etc. :)</p>
